      "When building a phone farm, the box matters more than individual phones. Learn how CPU generation, cooling design, and expansion capacity affect your long-term ROI.",
    content: `When I first got into phone farming, I piled old phones on a desk and plugged them into a computer. Within a week, cables were everywhere, phones overheated, and two devices failed.

The turning point was switching to a factory-built phone farm box with centralized power and active cooling. Here is what actually matters when choosing hardware:

**1. Chipset generation determines workload capacity**
Snapdragon 835/845 boxes handle social media automation well. Snapdragon 855+ and newer support heavier multi-app workloads and higher-resolution screen mirroring.

**2. Cooling is not optional**
Passive cooling fails above 15–20 devices. Look for 4+ fan active airflow with metal chassis heat dissipation. Our Guangzhou factory tests every unit with 72-hour burn-in.

**3. Scalability path**
Start with a 20-node 2U box, then expand with rackmount cabinets. Ensure your vendor supports modular expansion — not one-off custom builds.

**4. Software compatibility**
Verify ADB access, OTG support, and group control software compatibility before purchase. PhoneFarm ICU boxes ship with management software pre-configured.

    excerpt:
      "Cloud phones promise convenience, but real device farms win on trust scores, sensor accuracy, and platform compliance. Here is an honest comparison.",
    content: `Cloud phone services rent virtual Android instances on shared infrastructure. Real device phone farms use physical hardware in your control or ours.

**When cloud phones work:** Quick prototyping, light app testing, temporary campaigns with low account value.

**When real devices win:** Multi-account social media, ad verification, e-commerce operations, anything where platform trust scores and device fingerprints matter.

Real devices provide genuine IMEI, sensor data, GPS, and carrier profiles. Platforms increasingly detect shared cloud infrastructure patterns.

    content: `This guide walks through deploying a PhoneFarm ICU phone farm box from unboxing to first automated task.

**Step 1: Unbox and inspect**
Verify 20 device slots, power cable, USB cables, and cooling fans. Run visual QC on each node.

**Step 2: Power and network**
Connect 110V/220V power. Attach network router with dedicated IP per device group if required.

**Step 3: USB hub connection**
Single USB cable from box to control PC. Install management software and verify all devices appear in dashboard.

**Step 4: Device preparation**
Enable USB debugging, install required APKs in batch, configure proxy if needed.

**Step 5: First automation test**
Run a simple script on all 20 devices simultaneously. Monitor temperature and connection stability for 24 hours.

    excerpt:
      "Understand the trade-offs between screenless motherboard boxes and full phone boxes before you buy.",
    content: `**Motherboard Box advantages:** Lower per-node cost, smaller footprint, official Android system, ideal for headless automation.

**Motherboard Box limitations:** Re-authorizing USB debugging requires temporary screen attachment if authorization is lost.

**Phone Box advantages:** Full phone frame with SIM and camera support, customized ROM options, auto-reconnect without authorized PC.

**Phone Box limitations:** Slightly higher cost, unlocked bootloader on custom ROM models.

1. Right-click any device screen in the management dashboard
2. Select "Install APK" from the context menu
3. Choose one or multiple APK files
4. Confirm batch installation — progress shows per device

Tips: Group devices by project before installing. Verify APK signatures match your automation requirements. Contact support if you need custom deployment scripts.`,
